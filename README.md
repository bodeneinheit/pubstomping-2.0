**LOGOUT AND LOSS-AVOIDING REMOVED - ABUSING THE LOGOUT BUG MAY LEAD TO BAN**
# pubstomping2.0
## scripts which allow for easy nuke & stats farming:

- you will need the idkr client installed
- remove all accounts from the alt manager and add the account you want to use for insane stats/nuke farming
- put both js-files into `\Documents\idkr\scripts\`
- the script will **NOT** automatically log you in once you open the game **ANYMORE**
- at the top of the pubstomping file you can edit parameters to your liking, everything is explained there
- via this script you will **NOT** automatically be logged out and leave on deaths or other occasions, to ensure insane stats
- the f4 scripts allows you to hit f4 and you search for a new lobby (stats of the game will not count)

**you will need kills, deaths and streak counters turned on in your settings**

**make sure to view the file and EDIT IT to your liking, because it is set up quite strictly by default - using the default windows notepad works**

if you want any other features added send me a friend request on discord: boden#1337
(if the amount of requests seems high, i may add more parameters such as a minimum kd, kpg or nuke count at the end of the game)
coding is neither clean nor optimized, if you have any suggestions/improvements lmk
