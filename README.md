# pubstomping2.0
## scripts which allows for easy nuke & stats farming:

- you will need the idkr client installed
- remove all accounts from the alt manager and add the account you want to use for insane stats/nuke farming
- put both js-files into `\Documents\idkr\scripts\`
- the script will automatically log you in once you open the game
- at the top of the pubstomping file you can edit parameters to your liking, everything is explained there
- via this script you will automatically be logged out and leave on deaths or other occasions, to ensure insane stats (logging out and leaving ensures you dont get a loss for that game)
- the f4 scripts allows you to hit f4 and you will be logged out and search for a new lobby (stats of the game will not count)

if you want any other features added send me a friend request on discord: boden#1337
(if the request is high enough, i will add more parameters such as a minimum kd, kpg or nuke count at the end of the game)
